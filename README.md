# C++-project
this project involves building a system for student result management.

I defined multiple classes such as:
Person (with attributes like ID, name, email)
Student and Teacher, both inheriting from Person
Subject, GroupModule, Group, and Grade
Implemented class methods including:
Default and parameterized constructors
Operator overloading
Display student results in the form of a report, calculating:
Subject averages
Group module averages
General student averages
Final results (pass/fail) and mentions based on grade ranges
The project also involves handling various data management tasks (like adding, updating, and deleting records) and organizing code properly using header files for class declarations. 
The final goal is to generate and display a student grade report.
